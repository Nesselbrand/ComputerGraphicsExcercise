TASK 1:

Problem: What would be the test case?
-> Idea: have the cannocial value be the testcase, add Clickable Text/Button in the testcase description that reproduces the settings in the interactable canvas
-> Alternative: Have very sparse pixel data with using the whole scene as testcase :/


TASK 2:

Problem: x3d...
-> Try extracting cavnas data from internal canvas after x3d has loaded (canvas is literaly just a child/property). Requires extra handling in dispatcher/html/compare
-> No real alternatives afaik :/
